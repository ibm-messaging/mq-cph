MQOpts.desc = Generic options for MQ messaging worker thread classes.

d.desc = Destination prefix
d.type = char[MQ_Q_NAME_LENGTH]
d.xtra = The first part of the name of an MQ destination object (queue or topic) to put or get messages to,\n\
with the second part (a numeric suffix) to be provided by cphDestinationFactory.\n\
At present this entry is duplicated in DestinationFactory.properties, so no default is provided in this file.

jb.desc = WMQ queue manager to connect to.
jb.type = char[MQ_Q_MGR_NAME_LENGTH]

jt.dflt = mqc
jt.desc = WMQ transport (mqb, mqc).
jt.type = string
jt.xtra = "mqb" is local-bindings connections, "mqc" is TCP/IP connections.

jh.dflt = localhost
jh.desc = DNS/IP of provider host machine.
jh.type = char[80]
jh.xtra = Ignored unless jt=mqc

ar.dflt = 
ar.desc = Client Auto Re-connect
ar.type = String
ar.xtra = Sets the client CNO reconnect option. Options are MQCNO_RECONNECT_AS_DEF MQCNO_RECONNECT MQCNO_RECONNECT_DISABLED or \n\ MQCNO_RECONNECT_Q_MGR. Any option other than null (the default) or MQCNO_RECONNECT_DISABLED will require a ccdt to be used.

ccdt.dflt = 
ccdt.desc = Client channel definition table (CCDT) URL. Will use this CCDT if specified
ccdt.type = string

jp.dflt = 1414
jp.desc = Port of provider host machine.
jp.type = int
jp.xtra = Ignored unless jt=mqc

jc.dflt = SYSTEM.DEF.SVRCONN
jc.desc = WMQ Channel to connect to.
jc.type = char[MQ_CHANNEL_NAME_LENGTH]
jc.xtra = Ignored unless jt=mqc

jf.dflt = false
jf.desc = Use the fastpath option on the MQCONNX call
jf.type = bool
jf.xtra = Using this option means the application and the local-queue-manager agent are part of the same unit\n\
of execution. Using this option should give much higher throughput when using high message rates as it avoids\n\
a lot of thread switching. For this reason it is also easier to compare raw publish and susbscribe performance.\n\
Ignored unless jt=mqb.

jy.dflt = false
jy.desc = Use the readahead option on the MQCONNX call
jy.type = bool
jy.xtra = Using this option will enable any getter with the readahead option. Disabling it, defaults to the\n\
QM-defined behaviour.\n\
Ignored unless jt=mqc.

jl.dflt = UNSPECIFIED
jl.desc = Specify which SSL CipherSpec to use
jl.type = char[MQ_SSL_CIPHER_SPEC_LENGTH]
jl.xtra = If not using SSL, do not set parameter, the default "UNSPECIFIED" will map to empty string\n\

jw.dflt = UNSPECIFIED
jw.desc = Specify which TLS Certificate Label to use
jw.type = char[MQ_CERT_LABEL_LENGTH]
jw.xtra = Can only be set if a cipher spec is also provided, Only required if flowing a certificate for the client. The default "UNSPECIFIED" will map to empty string\n\

ms.dflt = 1000
ms.desc = Message size in bytes.
ms.type = unsigned int

mr.dflt = false
mr.desc = Randomise text in message (otherwise repeats every 57 chars)
mr.type = bool
mr.xtra = Text is pseudo-random. Each thread will generate it's own random text message that will be the same if a test is re-run.

rs.dflt = 0
rs.desc = Message buffer receive size in bytes. If left at default, will use value provided for ms
rs.type = unsigned int

pp.dflt = false
pp.desc = Use persistent messages.
pp.type = bool

p1.dflt = false
p1.desc = Use Put1 (Open q, put, close q)
p1.type = bool

tx.dflt = false
tx.desc = Transactionality.
tx.type = bool

cc.dflt = 1
cc.desc = Commit count (transaction batching).
cc.type = unsigned int
cc.xtra = The number of operations completed within a single transaction.  This only applies\n\
to test classes which only normally perform a single operation (such as Sender or Subscriber).\n\
Ignored if tx=false.

rf.dflt = false
rf.desc = Use RFH2 on message headers
rf.type = bool
rf.xtra = Ignored if mh=true.

mh.dflt = false
mh.desc = Use message handle for message properties
mh.type = bool

to.dflt = 5
to.desc = Polling timeout on receiving messages.
to.type = int
to.xtra = Polling interval in seconds. Threads will exit if a timeout occurs.\n\
Set this option to -1 to wait indefinitely.

us.dflt = 
us.desc = Username to authenticate as. 
us.type = java.lang.String
us.xtra = The ADOPTCTX setting will determine if this userID or the process owner is utilised for further security checks.

pw.dflt = 
pw.desc = Password to authenticate as.
pw.type = string

cv.dflt = true
cv.desc = Convert message data (MQGMO_CONVERT)
cv.type = bool

an.dflt = 
an.desc = Sets ApplName in the MQCNO
an.type = string
an.extra = This will be the name of the application, e.g. the APPLTAG field on display conn mqsc command.
